    <h1>Guessing Game</h1>
    <h2>My Bio</h2>
    <p>A great many years ago, I was born in Portland. Other than five years in the Navy, I've lived here all of my life.</p>
    <p>I work as an advertising photographer, currently managing a photography studio for a marketing company here in Portland. I became interested in photography at a young age. My earliest influence was my grandfather, who had a lifelong interest as an amateur photographer. My father, a graphic designer, gave me my first photo job photographing products for catalogs that he designed. After high school, I spent five years as a Navy photographer, where I traveled a lot, got married and finally returned home to Portland. After the Navy, I went to college, earning my bachelor's degree at PSU. My focus was fine arts and literature. After PSU I went to work as a photographer and then returned to school spending three years studing graphic design at PNCA. I have been working as an advertising photographer since.</p>
